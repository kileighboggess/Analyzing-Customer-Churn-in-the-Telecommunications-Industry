🔍 **Customer Churn Analysis in Telecommunications | Data Analyst Project using Python & SQL**

In this project, I analyzed customer churn patterns using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. My goal was to identify trends and behaviors leading to customer attrition and offer data-driven recommendations that telecom providers can implement to improve customer retention.

I used Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. After preprocessing the dataset, I saved it to SQLite and performed advanced SQL analysis to answer key business questions.

📊 **Key Insights:**
- Month-to-month customers churn nearly 3x more than long-term contract customers.
- Customers paying higher monthly bills and using electronic check payments are more likely to churn.
- Customers in their first year have the highest risk of churn, emphasizing the need for early engagement.
- Slightly higher churn rate among senior citizens.

📈 I created dynamic visualizations showing:
- Churn distribution across contract types
- Monthly Charges & Tenure trends by churn status
- Payment method risk profiles

These insights directly support business decisions in telecom: from revising payment onboarding processes to reshaping contract offerings. I also included actionable KPIs to communicate results clearly to non-technical stakeholders.

🎯 **Skills Demonstrated**:
- Data cleaning & wrangling (Python)
- EDA & visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Database design & querying (SQLite/SQL)
- KPI storytelling & stakeholder reporting

✅ Ideal for roles in: **Data Analytics**, **Business Intelligence**, **Customer Insights**, **Telecom Strategy**, and **Systems Analysis**.
